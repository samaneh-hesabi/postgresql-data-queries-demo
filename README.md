# 1. Project Overview
This project is a Python training repository that includes various examples and implementations of Python programming concepts, data analysis, and database operations. The project serves as a learning resource and practice environment for Python development.

# 2. Project Structure
The project contains the following main components:

## 2.1 Core Python Files
- `examples.py`: Basic Python examples and implementations
- `advanced_examples.py`: More complex Python programming examples
- `best_practices.py`: Demonstrations of Python best practices and coding standards
- `data_analysis.py`: Data analysis and manipulation examples using pandas
- `download_dataset.py`: Script for downloading and managing datasets
- `db_test.py`: Database connection and operation tests
- `config.py`: Configuration settings for the project

## 2.2 Test Directory
- `tests/`: Directory containing unit tests
  - `test_database.py`: Tests for database operations
  - `test_data_processor.py`: Tests for data processing operations

## 2.3 Data Directory
- `data/`: Directory containing datasets and data files used in the project

## 2.4 Configuration Files
- `requirements.txt`: Lists all Python package dependencies
- `LICENSE`: Project license information

# 3. Dependencies
The project requires the following Python packages (as specified in requirements.txt):
- psycopg2-binary (2.9.9): PostgreSQL database adapter
- pandas (2.2.1): Data analysis and manipulation library
- sqlalchemy (2.0.27): SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library

# 4. Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository
2. Create a virtual environment (recommended)
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Ensure you have PostgreSQL installed and running if you plan to use database features
5. Configure your environment variables in `config.py` or set them in your environment

# 5. File Descriptions

## 5.4 data_analysis.py
Focuses on data analysis using pandas:
- Data loading and manipulation
- Statistical analysis
- Data visualization examples
- Data cleaning techniques

## 5.5 download_dataset.py
Utility script for:
- Downloading datasets
- Data preprocessing
- Data storage management

## 5.6 db_test.py
Database operations including:
- Connection setup
- Basic CRUD operations
- Query examples
- Transaction management

## 5.7 config.py
Configuration management:

- Error handling

To run the tests:
```bash
python -m unittest discover tests
```

# 7. Usage Guidelines
- Each file contains self-contained examples that can be run independently
- Comments and docstrings provide detailed explanations
- Follow the examples in order of complexity (from examples.py to advanced_examples.py)
- Use the data directory for storing and accessing datasets
- Configure settings in config.py or through environment variables
